The following procedures and prerequisites must be met in order to do a Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-means Clustering:
1. Specify the Goal
The objective is to divide the client base into discrete groups according to their purchase patterns or other pertinent characteristics.
Result: Marketing plans that are specific to each group of customers.
2. Data Collection Customer Information: Compile information on the demographics, shopping habits, and other pertinent factors of your customers.
Sources: Web analytics, CRM systems, transactional databases, and customer surveys are a few places where information can be gathered.
3. Preprocessing Data
Data Purification: Address inconsistent data, outliers, and missing values.
Selecting suitable features for clustering is known as feature selection.
Normalization/Standardization: Adjust the feature sizes so that each feature contributes equally to the K-means distance measurements.
n4. EDA, or exploratory data analysis
Illustration: Plots, such as scatter, box, and histogram plots, can be used to visualize the distribution and relationships in the data.
Characteristic Statistics Compute summary statistics to get understanding of the information.
5. Clustering with K-means
Selecting K, the Number of Clusters:
To ascertain the ideal number of clusters, apply techniques such as the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, or Gap Statistic.
Training Models:
Utilize the K-means technique to divide up the clientele.
Once the centroids are initialized, minimize the within-cluster sum of squares and continue iterating until convergence.
Cluster Designation:
Each customer should be assigned to the closest cluster centroid.
6. Assessment
Cluster Analysis: Use measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Index, Silhouette Score, or eye inspection to assess the quality of the clusters.
Cluster Profiling: Examine each cluster's features in order to appropriately comprehend and categorize them.
7. Illustration
Cluster Plots: To see the clusters and their centroids, use heatmaps, pair plots, and scatter plots.
Emphasize the significance of distinct features in differentiating between the groupings.
8. Analysis and Perspectives
Customer Profiles: Create thorough profiles for every category of customers.
Convert the clustering results into useful business knowledge (e.g., product suggestions, focused marketing efforts).
9. Implementation Integration: Apply the clustering findings to CRM or business process integration.
Action Plan: Considering the requirements and profiles of each client segment, develop ways for connecting with them.
10. Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
